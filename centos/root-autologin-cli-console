I finally made it!

I think that's the problem was that getty.targets needed absolutely something called getty@tty1.service otherwise was the getty service was targetless (don't know exactly why or how, it's just a wild guess) and therefore that's what I did:

1. remove the original getty@tty1.service symlink:

Code:
 # rm /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@tty1.service
2. make a copy of the getty@.service file and call it getty@tty1.service

Code:
# cp /lib/systemd/system/getty@.service /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service
3. edit this file (the last line, must be ADDED):

Code:
[Service]
...
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I
...
[Install]
...
;Alias=getty@tty1.service
4. make a symlink in getty.target.wants

Code:
 # ln -s /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@tty1.service
5. Reboot. It everything went fine you will be logged in as root.

6. If point 5 is successful, dance in celebration! You've earned it!
